# Document Scanner App using Python and OpenCV

## Steps:
1. Detect edges.
2. Use the edges in the image to find the contour (outline) representing the piece of paper being scanned.
3. Apply a perspective transform to obtain the top-down view of the document.

## Prerequisites before using this software :
1. Python
2. OpenCV

## Compiling and Running

Put all the files in single folder and run scan.py using python or CMD

Example: python3 scan.py --image /image/example.jpg

Note: Make sure to have an appropriate image for testing - see the image folder
